Question 4
```{r, include=T}
polyroot(c(1,-2))
polyroot(c(1,-0.45,-0.05))
```

Question 6
```{r, out.width='80%',out.height='80%'}
set.seed(123)
Z = rnorm(300)
plot(Z, type = 'l', main = "White Noise for Series Z")
acf(Z)
```

```{r, out.width='80%',out.height='80%'}
set.seed(123)
Z = rnorm(300)
Y = Z^2
plot(Y, type = 'l', main = "White Noise for Series Y")
acf(Y)

Box.test(Y, type="Ljung-Box")
```

Since graphs shows no obvious trend as function of timeline and they have constant mean, series z and y are both stationary.

There is no noticeable difference between them. Since we have Y = Zt^2, mean of Y cannot be zero.

No, Y is white noise sequence, because lag values are under the boundary and only auto-correlation = 1 when lag is 0.
